# Random Bosses Sizes
Random Bosses Sizes is a mod that random scales the boss's size.
So you could have a King Slime that's the size of your base, or a teeny tiny Empress of Light as your boss.

You can config the min/max random scale range, include boss parts (Skeletron Hands, Eye of Cthulhu's Servents, etc), and to include all enemies/friendly NPCs.
